Shopping list assistant app backend

## Overview :male_detective:
Shopping-mate is an application to help you to create, manage and share shopping lists.

## Prerequisites :rotating_light:
This project requires a database whose connection url must be passed as an environment variable.

## Environment variables ðŸ“‹
Some variables are expected to exist into the environment. In my development environment I'm using and `.env` file 
with these properties:
```properties
DATABASE_URL=<schema>://<user>:<pass>@<host>:<port>/<db_name>
SECRET_KEY=
```

## Running the application ðŸš€
```bash
docker-compose up
```
